Comments:

-Some messy or missing indentation. Be absolutely strict!â€¨
-Your top-level command array allocation isn't allocating enough bytes: 

	char** commandArr = malloc(sizeof(char*) * wordCount+1);

Due to order of operations, you need to write this as

	char** commandArr = malloc(sizeof(char*) * (wordCount + 1));

to allocate the full 8 bytes for the NULL on the end.  This may be the primary reason for your memory errors.

-A name like "parse_helper" doesn't reveal anything about what the function is doing. Something like "count_chars" would be clearer.

-In command_print, inner loop is unnecessary -- just use printf with %s to print the string all at once rather than looping over printf calls with %c printing one char at a time.

Score: 85/100
